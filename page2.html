    <h1>My Letter to You ❤️</h1>
    
    <div class="love-letter">
        My dearest Shru ❤️<br><br>
        
        It's been more than 7 months since 10th May 2025, and every day with you is the best. Your smile kills me, your eyes pull me in, and your voice is my favorite sound ever.<br><br>
        
        The way you treat me, how you forgive my big mistakes (stuff that could've ended us but you stayed), how you turned this sad boy into the happiest guy alive, and how you're always there for me... I feel the safest with you. You're my everything.<br><br>
        
        That birthday surprise on 25th Nov — the rose, Harry Potter keychain, and that cheesecake (best dessert in my 16 years) — was perfect because it came from you.<br><br>
        
        2026 is gonna be even better with you, princess. Can't wait for more mall dates, late calls, and memories.<br><br>
        
        I love you more than anything.<br><br>
        
        Forever yours,<br>
        Aaru 😘
